# URL Shortener

This project is mainly based on this tutorial series by Tensor https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyBXz9SpPqE&feature=youtu.be

However this project does several things differently:
- Use Echo webserver instead go Chi for simpler syntax
- No real redirection is actually made
- Only support MongoDB and JSON (from Echo library)
